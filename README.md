#### My personal website! ###
Built from scratch with a little help from HTML and CSS. I thought it would be nice to just use HTML and CSS, so no fancy transitions and animations this time. And yes, I know we can do animations with CSS3, we're just not using it here.

### Technical assistance ###
Because every little piece of 'code' on this repo is hard to understand, I get why you'd want technical assistance. But before we dive into that, here's a bad joke to keep your attention: Where do cows go for a first date? To the mooooovies! 

Please file an issue if something isn't working for you.
